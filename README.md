# koch

Koch manages oc cluster configurations and allows cli authentication through the usage of Auth server and API k8s server.  
Koch automates the cluster login process by calling a proxy public api. 
Koch can request temporary credentials to login through terminal without the usage of browser and service account.  
Koch has been tested against OpenshiftÂ® v3.x and 4.x.  
Koch is a lightweight bash script. This script has been tested with Nixos (22.11). Compatibility with other operating system should not be an issue whether requirements are installed in the system. You can create a pull request or an issue whether is not working with your operating system. 

# Requirements
- sh, used to execute the script.
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq), used to manage yaml configuration (tested with v4.33.0)
- [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl), used to request temporary authentication token
- [oc](https://github.com/openshift/oc), used to perform login and logout operation once received the token.
- [bw](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients)  (bitwarden-cli, optional), used to request credentials
- [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) (optional), used to parse credentials json 

# Recommended software
- [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship), used to know the current kubectl context 
- [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx), to change between kubectl context
- [kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx), to change the current namespace
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) , to properly select the kubernetes context and namespace

# Download and install

# Usage
You can get the help command by simply typing
```
koch
```

The following command defines a cluster configuration.
```
koch define <context-name> --auth="$AUTH_SERVER" --api="$API_SERVER" --context="$KUBECTL_CONTEXT" --secrethandler="$SECRETHANDLER" --secretname="$SECRETNAME" --insecure="true"
```
where context-name represents the cluster configuration name.
$AUTH\_SERVER represents the host and the scheme used to point out the authentication server ( for instance https://myauthservice.com )
$API\_SERVER is the scheme and the host of api server used to perform login (for instance, https://apiserver:6443 )

Once the configuration is defined, the user can perform authentication by using the context name.
```
koch login <context-name>
```
This command requests the temporary authentication token and perform authentication using oc login.
```
koch logout
```
Koch logout performs the logout operation.
